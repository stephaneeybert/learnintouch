[   5]By default a user cannot register himself in the system.\n\nOnly an administrator can register a user.\n\nBut to ease the administration of the website users, it is possible to let the users register themselves, and this without the intervention of an administrator.

[   7]Account validity (weeks):
[   8]Send the login parameters:
[   9]When a user has been registered in the system, an email containing his login name and password can be sent to him.\n\nThis allows the user to keep his connection parameters.
[  10]Registration security code:
[  11]When a user registers himself in the system, he can be asked to type in a code.\n\nBecause this code is displayed in an image, it can only be read by a person.\n\nThis security mechanism prevents the automatic registrations by web robots.
[  12]Number of users per page:
[  13]To avoid too long a list of users, a fixed number of users are displayed per page.
[  14]It is possible to specify a validity period for the new user accounts.\n\nWhen a user has REGISTERED HIMSELF, he can log in with his password only during a period of time.\n\nDuring that period an administrator is able to confirm the user registration and the user login is no longer limited in time.\n\nBut if the user account is not confirmed by an administrator in time then the user won't be able to log in when this period expires.\n\nIf this period is null then the user who has registered himself won't be able to log in right after his registration and will have to wait for his account confirmation by an administrator before being able to log in.\n\nThis period is expressed in weeks.
[  15]Display of the profile link:
[  16]By default the user name is the link to the user profile page.\n\nBut a specific link can be displayed as well.
[  17]Display of the password link:
[  18]By default no link to the change password page is displayed.\n\nBut a link can be displayed.
[  19]Validate the domain name:
[  20]By default, the domain name of the email is not validated during the user registration.\n\nValidating the domain name ensures the email address is hosted by a server connected to the internet and registered with a domain name.
[  21]Width of the images:
[  22]The image width when they are displayed on a computer.
[  23]Automatic login period (weeks):

[  26]When a user chooses to stay logged in, his login parameters are kept for a certain period of time.\n\nThis period of time is expressed in weeks.\n\nAfter the end of this period the user must once again log in manually.\n\nHe can of course choose again to stay logged in for a new period.
[  27]Width of the images (phone):
[  28]The image width when they are displayed on a phone or small screen mobile device.
[  29]Token login period (weeks):
[  30]Some pages of the website can be accessed by the user by clicking on a link containing a token.\n\nFor example an email sent to a user can contain a link to view a protected page of the website.\n\nTo offer an instant access to such a page it is possible not to force the user to log into the website before accessing the page.\n\nA login is thus offered in the link to the page.\n\nFor security reasons, it is possible to specify a validity period for this login.\n\nAfter the end of this period the login expires and the user must log in manually to access the page.\n\nThis period is expressed in weeks.\n\nIf no period is specified then the login in the link will never expire.

[  50]Mini login form:
[  51]By default, the mini login is displayed as a link to the login page.\n\nBut it is possible to display it as a mini form with two input fields, one for the email address and one for the password.
[  52]Allow expired login:
[  53]By default, when a user login has an expiration date and that date has passed, the user cannot log in anymore.\n\nIn that case, the user is not identified and he cannot access the secured pages of the website.\n\nBut it is possible to allow the user to log in even if the expiration date has passed.\n\nIn that case, the user is identified but he still cannot access the secured pages of the website.\n\nIn both cases the user cannot access the secured pages of the website.
[  54]Confirm the registration by email:
[  55]By default, the email address typed in by the user during his registration, is considered valid.\n\nBut it is possible to ask the user to confirm his email address, so as to make sure the given email address is his and not a fake one.\n\nIn that case, an email is sent to the user after his registration, containing a link that he needs to click to confirm his email address.
