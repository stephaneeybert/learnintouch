[   0]Post a message
[   1]Send an email when receiving a message:
[   2]The guestbook is empty.
[   3]When a message is posted in the guestbook, an email can be sent to the email address of the website.\n\nThis is to notify the web site manager that a message has been posted in the guestbook.
[   4]Include the message:
[   5]By default, the email sent to the email address of the website does not contain the message posted in the guestbook.\n\nThe email only contains a link to the message that is kept in the guestbook.\n\nBut it is possible to include the message in the email content.\n\nThis makes it possible to immediately read the message.
[   6]Ask for a security code:
[   7]When a visitor posts a message in the guestbook, he can be asked to type in a security code.\n\nBecause this code is displayed in an image, it can only be read by a person.\n\nThis security mechanism prevents the automatic posting of messages in the guestbook by web robots.
[  10]Secure the access:
[  31]By default, the users are not required to log in, in order to post a message in the guestbook.\n\nBut the guestbook can be protected and its access reserved to the registered users of the website.\n\nIn that case, a user will have to log in before being able to post a message in the guestbook.
