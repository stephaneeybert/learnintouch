[   1]The properties represent the styles applied to the models, the containers and the elements.\n\nThey apply a formating on the web site content.\n\nDepending on the context, it may happen that some properties are not applied as expected.\n\nThe properties are the cascading style sheet (CSS) of the web.\n\nThe properties of a container or an enclosing element are inherited by any inner element.\n\nThis can explain why sometimes a property that has not been specified to an element appears still to be applied on the element.\n\nIt is recommanded to have a basic knowledge of the CSS in order to best use the style properties.
