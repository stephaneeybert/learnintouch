[   1]Send an email when receiving a message:
[  31]When a message is received from a visitor, an email can be sent to the email address of the website.\n\nThis is to notify the website manager that a contact message has been received.
[   2]Acknowledgement message:
[  32]After a visitor has sent a message, an acknowledgement message is displayedto him.\n\nThe text of this message can be edited.
[   3]Comment message:
[   4]A customized comment message can be displayed above the form.
[   5]Register the email address:
[   6]When a visitor posts a message, he must leave an email address.\n\nThe email address can then be seen with the visitor's message.\n\nBut it is also possible to add the email address to the list of email addresses used in the mailings.\n\nAll the email addresses left by the visitors are then registered in the list of email addresses and can later be used when sending mailings.\n\nThis allows the list of email addresses used in the mailings, to grow with the email addresses obtained when the visitors post a message.
[   7]Delete old messages:
[   8]Old messages can be automatically deleted after a certain period of time.\n\n This is to avoid clogging the contact message system with old messages that have been processed since long.\n\nA contact message, regardless of its status, is automatically and permanently deleted at the end of this duration.\n\nThe duration is expressed in months.
[   9]Include the message:
[  10]By default, the email sent to the email address of the website does not contain the message received from the visitor.\n\nThe email only contains a link to the message that is kept in the system.\n\nBut it is possible to include in the email content, the message from the visitor.\n\nThis makes it possible to immediately read the visitor's message.
[  11]Acknowledgement page:
[  12]When a user sends a message, an aknowledgement message is displayed.\n\nBut it is possible to display a web page instead.\n\nIn that case, the web page will be displayed in place of the default aknowledgement message.\n\nThe web page can thus contain more than just a simple aknowledgement message.\n\nIt can, for example, display an address, an access map...
[  13]Do not ask for a security code:
[  14]When a visitor posts a contact message, he is asked to type in a security code.\n\nBecause this code is displayed in an image, it can only be read by a person.\n\nThis security mechanism prevents the automatic posting of contact messages by web robots.\n\nIt is not a good idea to disable this feature.
[  15]Form email address:
[  16]It is possible to send the content of a form to an email address.\n\nThe email address specified will receive an email each time a form is posted by a visitor.\n\nIf no email address is specified then the email address of the website will be used.\n\nTo correctly connect a form to the form inbox, the 'action' attribute of the 'form' tag must have the value:
[  17]Like in:
[  18]\n\nwhere the optional contactRecipientEmail and contactAcknowledgementMessage variables are the email address the form is sent to and the acknowledgement message displayed to the website visitor.
