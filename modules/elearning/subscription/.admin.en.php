[  29]In order to follow a course, a participant must first subscribe to a session of the course.\n\nOnce he has subscribed, he is then able to do the exercises of the course.\n\nIf a teacher is assigned to the participant for his course, then the teacher will be able to follow the results of his participant.\n\nA participant can consult the list of exercises of the courses he has subscribed to.\n\nIf a participant has subscribed to a course then he can access the list of exercises of the course by loggin in the website.\n\nIn that list he can see the exercises he has done and his results for each exercise.\n\nHe can also see the exercises he hasn't yet done, as well as the next exercise to do.\n\nNote that the results of an exercise are registered only when the exercise is done for the first time.\n\nIf an exercise is done again then the results are not registered another time.\n\nThis list can therefore offer differents possibilities to the participant regarding his exercises.\n\nHe can thus either do all his exercises, immediately and in any order, or only do the one exercise specified by his teacher.\n\nThis list may also allow him to do again the exercises he has already done.
