[   3]Points:
[   4]Question:
[   5]By default each question is valued 1 point.\n\nBut it is possible to specify a number of points for the question.\n\nIf no points are specified then the question is valued 1 point.
[   6]The questions are grouped inside pages of questions.\n\nEach question is composed of a sentence and possibly an image or a Flash animation and an audio file.\n\nThe questions can be displayed in a chosen order.\n\nThere are two types of questions.\n1- Multiple choices questions\n2- Type in questions\n\nIf a question has more than one possible answer then it is a multiple choices question. Otherwise it has only one possible answer and it is a type in question.\n\nTo place the answer within the question, and not after, insert a location marker within the question.\n\nThe location marker is the sequence of three question mark characters '???'.\n\nFor example, a question might be written like 'The ??? is fine'.\n\nNote that the location marker is not required if the answer is located after the question.\n\nThus the question 'The car is ???' can simply be written 'The car is'.\n\nFor type in questions, the length of the type in field can be specified with the sequence of three question mark characters.\n\nFor example, a 10 characters long field would be specified like ???10 and the question could be 'The car is ???10 in the street'.\n\nIf a question is to be displayed withing the text and not below, then only the answer input field will be displayed within the text, and the question itself will not be displayed.
[   7]A question is always part of a page of questions.\n\nThere are usually several questions per page.
[   8]Hint:
[   9]A hint can be displayed with the question, to help the participant find the solution to the question.\n\nThe hint can be a verb to conjugate, a synonym, a short sentence, etc...
[  10]Explanation:
[  11]An explanation about the question can be displayed under each question result.\n\nIt can give the participant some additional information about the question's solution and help him understand his possible mistake.\n\nAn example of explanation could be:\n\n'Eventually' is a false friend. Although you may think the translation is 'eventuellement', it actually is 'finalement'.\n\nTo display, the answer given by the participant, within the explanation text, use the sequence of three question mark characters '???'.\n\nThe explanation is thus typed in as:\n\n'Eventually' is a false friend. Although you may think the translation is '???', it actually is 'finalement'.
[  12]Create two answers (True/False):
[  13]It is possible to create two answers named 'True' and 'False' and to specify which one of the two is the solution.\n\nThis allows for the rapid creation of True/False questions.
[  14]Solution:
[  15]Save the explanation
[  16]True
[  17]False
[  18]The number of words, for a typed in text answer, must be or greater or equal to 1.
[  19]Number of words:
[  20]If the question type is a text to type in, then it is possible to specify the number of words the text should contain.\n\nThis is to give an indication to the participant, on the size of the text he is supposed to type in.\n\nThis is only used if the question is a text to type in.
