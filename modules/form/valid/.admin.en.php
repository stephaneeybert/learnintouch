[   7]A validator is used to validate data input by the user.\n\nBy using one or several validators on a form field, it is possible to make sure the user of the form has typed some correct information in the form field.\n\nIt is possible to use several validators for one same form field.\n\nA validator displays a message to the user if some incorrect information has been typed in.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use validators so as to help the user typing in some correct information.\n\nThere are several types of validators to serve different purposes.\n\nFor example, to validate a required email address, there could be two validators used: one to validate that an email address has been typed in, and another one to validate that the email address has a correct format.
