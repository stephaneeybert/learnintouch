[   9]The web site maintenance is done by administrators.\n\nThe administrators perform the creation and maintenance operations of the web site.\n\nThe web site is composed of modules. An administrator can only operate on a module if he has the permission to do so.\n\nOne or more modules are therefore allocated to each administrator.\n\nAn administrator can be a 'super' administrator. In that case he can create, update and delete other administrators.\n\nIt is therefore strongly advised to grant the 'super' administrator status only when it is a strict necessity.

[  12]The preferences
[  13]You should have an administrator with the same email address as the one in the field "website.email" in the profile of the website.
[  14]The "website.email" address receives all notifications emails.\n\nFor example, when a contact message is sent through the website contact form, an notification email can be automatically sent to the "website.email" address.\n\nIt is therefore important that someone receives these emails.\n\nAn administrator is the right person for that and his email address should be specified in the "website.email" field in the profile of the website.
[  70]Search:
[  71]It can become tedious to navigate in the list of administrators to find a particular administrator.\n\nTo avoid this, it is possible to type in all or part of the firstname, lastname or login name of an administrator and do a search based on the typed in text.\n\nThe search result will display all the administrators matching the searched text.
