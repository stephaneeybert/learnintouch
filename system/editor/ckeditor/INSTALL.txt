As of CKEditor 4 the iframedialog plugin has to be downloaded separately from http://ckeditor.com/addon/iframedialog and unzipped into the plugins/ directory.


Download and unpack the CKEditor into the directory api/js/editor/


For each custom plugin:

Add the plugin name in the file system/editor/ckeditor/CKEditorUtils.php
- add the button in the toolbar
- add the plugin name in the extra plugins property

Create a soft link to the plugin directory from the directory js/editor/ckeditor/plugins/

ln -s ../../../../system/editor/ckeditor/plugins/imageUpload imageUpload
