[  19]Language:
[  21]The website can have content in several languages.\n\nThe languages used by the website must be activated in the languages module.\n\nA navigation bar can have items in each of the active languages.\n\nA language is thus assigned to each item of a navigation bar.\n\nThe item of the navigation bar is only displayed if its language is the one chosen by the user visiting the web site.\n\nIt is possible to change the language of the item and choose another language among the active languages.
[   8]By default an item is visible and is displayed in its navigation bar.\n\nBut it can be hidden. In that case, it is not displayed in its navigation bar.\n\nThis feature offers an easy way to temporarily hide an item.
[  14]A navigation bar item can have a description.\n\nThe item description is displayed when the mouse cursor passes over the item.\n\nOtherwise, if a navigation bar item has no description, then it is the item name that is displayed to the users.
[  13]A navigation bar item can point either to a page within the web site or to the page of another web site on the internet. \n\nThe web page can be specified in three different ways: \n\n- It can be selected in the list of pages of the web site (to point to a page within the web site) \n\n- It can be selected in the list of predefined pages (to point to a predefined page within the web site) \n\n- It can be manually typed in (to point to another web site) \n\nChoose between selecting a web page and typing in a web site address. \n\nNote that if a web page is selected and a predefined page is also selected, then the predefined page is ignored. \n\nAs well, if a web page is selected and a web site address is also typed in, then the web site address is ignored.\n\nIf an email address is typed in the url field then the link will be an email link.
[  26]Model:
[  27]A model can be assigned to a navigation bar item.\n\nIn that case, the web page pointed to by the navigation bar item is displayed in the specified model.\n\nOtherwise, the web page is displayed in the current model.\n\nThis allows a website to display web pages in different models.\n\nFor example, there can be one default model for most of the web pages and another model for some web pages that are related to a particular event.
