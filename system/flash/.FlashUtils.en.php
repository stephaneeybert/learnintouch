[  31]The Flash intro can be hidden.\n\nIn that case, it is not displayed on the web site.
[  32]The Flash intro can be displayed only once at most during a visit.\n\nThis allows the visitors not to be annoyed by a repeating display of the Flash intro during their visit.\n\nA visit ends when the visitor shuts down his browser.
[  33]By default the Flash intro is displayed on every visit.\n\nEven if it is displayed at most once per visit, it can still be annoying to the visitor if several visits are paid in a short period of time.\n\nTo avoid this repeated display, a periodicity can be specified, during which the Flash intro will be displayed only once, even if several visits are paid.\n\nThe periodicity is expressed as a number of days.\n\nIf the number of days is 0 (zero) then the periodicity is not used.\n\nFor example, a number of days set to 1 will display the Flash intro only once per day for each visitor.
[  34]By default the Flash intro is displayed in the main window of the browser.\n\nBut it can instead be displayed in a popup window.
