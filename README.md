LearnInTouch, learn, teach and keep in touch !

LearnInTouch is a CRM complete with an elearning platform for language schools, a hobby project that snowballed into an extensive product.

Started in 2003 before the age of frameworks it is layered with its custom DAO and dependency injection.

Over the years it has been ajaxified and now web sockets allow for real time dual control between participants.

The teachers can sit and watch live their students answer questions, and take the controls when a mistake is being done.

The product has a built-in template and CSS editor which make it possible to design websites for computers and phone devices without having to touch any HTML markup and CSS properties.

Although the product is mature and works well on some production site, it has now been discontinued and is no longer under development.
